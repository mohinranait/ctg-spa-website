                  A salt bath is a therapeutic spa treatment that involves
                  soaking in water infused with various mineral-rich salts. It's
                  designed to promote relaxation, detoxify the body, soothe
                  muscles, and improve skin health. Unlike a regular bath, a
                  salt bath leverages the natural properties of specific salts
                  for enhanced well-being.

              Relaxation and Stress Relief: The warmth of the water combined
              with the minerals in the salt helps to relax tense muscles and
              calm the nervous system. Many salts, especially Epsom salts
              (magnesium sulfate), are known for their muscle-relaxing
              properties, which contribute to overall stress reduction and a
              sense of peace. Detoxification: Salts, particularly Epsom and Dead
              Sea salts, are believed to help draw out toxins and impurities
              from the skin through a process called reverse osmosis. This can
              leave you feeling refreshed and revitalized.
