                  A body treatment in a spa setting refers to a range of

                  health and appearance of the skin on the body, beyond just the
                  face. These treatments aim to provide relaxation,
                  detoxification, hydration, and overall skin rejuvenation. Body
                  scrubs are a common and essential part of many body

              What is a Body Scrub and What are its Benefits?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-lg">
              A body scrub is a popular skincare product, typically a paste made
              with small granular particles (such as salt, sugar, or coffee
              grounds) mixed with oils or moisturizing agents. When gently
              rubbed onto the skin, it effectively removes dead skin cells and
              impurities from the skin's surface. Prevention of Ingrown Hairs:
              By clearing dead skin cells and unclogging pores, body scrubs can
              help prevent ingrown hairs. Enhanced Moisturizer Absorption: After
              exfoliation, the skin is clean and soft, allowing lotions and
              moisturizers to penetrate more effectively and provide deeper
              hydration.
